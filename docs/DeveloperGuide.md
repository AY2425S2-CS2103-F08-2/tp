### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of InsureBook.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes `Main` and `MainApp`) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

-   [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of InsureBook.
-   [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
-   [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of InsureBook in memory.
-   [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

-   defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
-   implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `RenewalsTable`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

-   executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
-   listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
-   keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
-   depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Policy` objects residing in the `Model`.

#### Person Card UI

The person card UI is implemented using the following components:

-   `PersonListCard.fxml`: Defines the layout of each person card, including:

    -   Name and ID
    -   Contact information (phone, email, address)
    -   Policy information (policy number and renewal date)
    -   Tags

-   `PersonCard.java`: Controls the display of person information in the card:
    -   Binds UI elements to person data
    -   Formats the renewal date display with the prefix "Renewal date: " for clarity
    -   Manages tag display

The person card provides a compact view of all essential client information, making it easy for insurance agents to quickly access client details and track policy renewals. The renewal date is prominently displayed with a clear label to help agents quickly identify when policies need to be renewed.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

-   When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
-   All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

-   stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
-   stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
-   stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
-   does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

-   can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
-   inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
-   depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Policy Renewal Feature

The policy renewal feature allows insurance agents to track and manage policy renewals for their clients. It is implemented using the following components:

#### Policy Class

The `Policy` class represents an insurance policy and contains:

-   Policy number (in format POL-XXX)
-   Renewal date
-   Methods to calculate days until renewal

#### ViewRenewalsCommand

The `ViewRenewalsCommand` allows users to view policies due for renewal within a specified number of days:

-   Takes a parameter for number of days (1-365)
-   Optional sort parameter (by name or date)
-   Filters the person list based on policy renewal dates
-   Updates the UI to show filtered results

#### Implementation

The renewal tracking mechanism is facilitated by the `Policy` class and the `ViewRenewalsCommand`. Here's how it works:

1. When a user executes `viewrenewals n/30`, the command is parsed by `ViewRenewalsCommandParser`.
2. The parser validates the days parameter (must be 1-365) and optional sort parameter.
3. A new `ViewRenewalsCommand` is created with the validated parameters.
4. When executed, the command:
    - Filters the person list to include only those with policies due within the specified days
    - Updates the model's filtered person list
    - Updates the renewals table in the UI
    - Returns a command result with the number of matching entries

The following sequence diagram shows how the viewrenewals operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/ViewRenewalsSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800"/>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to calculate renewal due dates**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calculate days until renewal on demand

    -   Pros: More memory efficient
    -   Cons: May impact performance if calculated frequently

-   **Alternative 2:** Store days until renewal as a field
    -   Pros: Faster retrieval
    -   Cons: Needs to be updated daily

**Aspect: Where to implement filtering logic**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** In the command

    -   Pros: Keeps filtering logic with the command that needs it
    -   Cons: Logic might be duplicated if needed elsewhere

-   **Alternative 2:** In the Model
    -   Pros: Centralizes filtering logic
    -   Cons: Makes Model more complex

### Renewal Date Update Feature

The renewal date update feature allows insurance agents to directly update a client's policy renewal date by specifying the policy number, without needing to find the client's index in the list. This feature streamlines the renewal date management process.

#### Implementation

The renewal date update functionality is implemented through the `RenewCommand` class, which follows the command pattern used throughout the application. The feature is primarily made up of the following components:

1. `RenewCommand` - Executes the updating of a renewal date for a client with a specific policy number
2. `RenewCommandParser` - Parses the user input into a RenewCommand object

The following class diagram shows the structure of the Renew Command:

```
+----------------+       +---------------------+
| RenewCommand   |<------|RenewCommandParser   |
+----------------+       +---------------------+
| -policyNumber  |       | +parse(String)      |
| -newRenewalDate|       +---------------------+
+----------------+
| +execute(Model)|
+----------------+
        |
        | uses
        v
+----------------+
|     Model      |
+----------------+
```

The feature works through the following process flow:

1. The user enters a command in the format `renew pol/POLICY_NUMBER r/RENEWAL_DATE`.
2. The `LogicManager` passes the command string to `AddressBookParser`.
3. `AddressBookParser` identifies the command as a `renew` command and delegates to `RenewCommandParser`.
4. `RenewCommandParser` extracts the policy number and renewal date, validates them, and creates a new `RenewCommand` object.
5. `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method of the command object.
6. The `RenewCommand`:
    - Filters the list of persons to find those with the specified policy number
    - Validates that exactly one match is found (not zero, not multiple)
    - Creates a new `Person` with the updated renewal date
    - Updates the model with the new `Person` object
    - Returns a `CommandResult` with a success message

The following sequence diagram shows how the renew operation works:

```
User            :AddressBookParser     :RenewCommandParser    :RenewCommand            :Model
 |                     |                      |                     |                     |
 | renew command       |                      |                     |                     |
 |-------------------->|                      |                     |                     |

 |                     | parse                |                     |                     |

```

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to identify the client to update:**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use policy number as identifier.

    -   Pros: More intuitive for insurance agents who often reference clients by policy number.
    -   Cons: Requires handling cases where multiple clients have the same policy number.

-   **Alternative 2:** Use client index in the displayed list.
    -   Pros: Consistent with other commands like `edit` and `delete`.
    -   Cons: Less convenient as agents need to find the index first.

**Aspect: Error handling for duplicate policy numbers:**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show error and suggest using `edit` command.

    -   Pros: Prevents unintended updates to the wrong client.
    -   Cons: Less convenient when there are duplicate policy numbers.

-   **Alternative 2:** Update all clients with matching policy numbers.
    -   Pros: More convenient if updating all matching policies is the intended action.
    -   Cons: High risk of unintended updates; insurance operations generally require precision.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

-   `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
-   `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
-   `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

-   **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

    -   Pros: Easy to implement.
    -   Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

-   **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
    itself.
    -   Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    -   Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

-   Insurance Agents who need to keep track of Customers / Potential Customers
-   Moderate Tech saviness.
-   prefer desktop apps over other types
-   can type fast
-   prefers typing to mouse interactions
-   is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: It solves the issue of managing a large clientele by simplifying client tracking, automating follow-ups, and staying organized. By using InsureBook, insurance agents can focus more on growth and client retention, rather than spending more time on admin tasks and more time on sales.
